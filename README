KawaPolska, a polish-enabled version of YanoneKaffesatz
=============

Repository of KawaPolska, a font based on YanoneKaffesatz, font created by Yanone and released in 2004 under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/de/deed.en

YanoneKaffesatz is a very beautiful font unfortunately it lacks central european diacritics like so many free fonts do. There exists a 2009 commercial edition of YanoneKaffesatz called FF Kava, which is a little different than Kaffesatz, includes CE diacritics, but is also non-free both in terms of price and licence liberty. This is an effort to extend the 2004 free font with polish diacritics. The new name mean "Polish Coffee", in polish. 

I invite everyone out there to join in on the  fun, I am just an amauteur typography enthusiast, so all help is appreciated. Patches with non-polish diacritics are also very welcome. I am using fontforge for editing.


TODO
-------------
1. Only Regular font done for now, do all the others
2. Change font name inside font files from YanoneKaffesatz to KawaPolska
3. Add Polish ligatures, for example łł, st, and perhaps some more experiments like cz/dz/rz/sz/ch
4. Invite people from other countries to work on their own national diacritics
